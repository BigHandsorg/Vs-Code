After downloading C/C++ extension as recommended " includepath to configurations." I now have vs_bootstrapper on the side, which seems to have 50+ source controls in it and I don't know what they do... I am still unable to run C++ code at this time.

Success  Downloaded Gcc, put it in my c folder and went into edit system environment to include Gcc folder in the path. Then In VS code, I added an extension called "code runner"

New error. Identifiers "cout" and "endl" is underfined

after reloading, cout and endl were recognized, however now when running a coin-flipping program, the second string written in the program is not recognized, but the first string is recognized...
